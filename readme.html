This is the readme for the NEURON and python model associated with the
paper

Clay JR, Paydarfar D, Forger DB (2008) A simple modification of the
Hodgkin and Huxley equations explains type 3 excitability in squid
giant axons. J R Soc Interface 5:1421-8

This model was contributed by Mohit Ganguly and was implemented by him
and John R Clay.

This model requires NEURON with python to be installed which is
available for free from <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a>

To run either autolaunch from ModelDB or download and extract this
archive, compile the mod files and start with a command like

python -i clay_mohit.py

For more help on downloading and running the model see
